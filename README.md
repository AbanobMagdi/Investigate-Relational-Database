## Exploration of DVD rental data from PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL's website provides a sample database of DVD rentals. Here I've compiled queries of varying complexity as a way to document the work done with the database and to keep track of my growth and skills in SQL.

#### Structure
The clauses and tools used in each query are listed as the title for each section, followed by a brief description of what the query does and the query itself (the queries will not run). Queries 1-3 are answers to challenges provided by Udaicty.

Queries 4-7 were written to answer specific questions about the database, which can be found under the clauses and tools used. These sections (will) include visualizations and discussions/conclusions.
#### Notice
This code does not run in the notebook, but an entity relationship diagram (ERD) exists in the repository. Tasks were completed as part of the requirements for Udacity's Programming for Data Science Nanodegree.
